# 5. Make sure everyone can use the service

Provide a service that everyone can use, including disabled people and people with other legally protected characteristics. And people who do not have access to the internet or lack the skills or confidence to use it.

## Why it’s important

Government services must work for everyone who needs to use them. Public sector organisations have a legal duty to consider everyone’s needs when they’re designing and delivering services.

Inclusive, accessible services are better for everyone. For example, using simple words helps people who are in a hurry as well as people who have a learning disability.

## What it means

Service teams should:

- meet accessibility standards, including both online and offline parts
- avoid excluding any groups within the audience they’re intended to serve
- carry out research with participants who represent the potential audience for the service, including people with access needs
- make sure that people are not excluded from being able to use the service because they lack digital skills or internet access, providing appropriate assisted digital support to cover any gaps
